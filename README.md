<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repo is a collection of the tools, features and extensions I seem to write or rewrite for every project. Until now, that is. It contains a wide range of things - anywhere from pooling frameworks to standart damage and health systems, property drawers for interface fields, editor-serializable dictionaries, etc.

Here are the premises:
* The tools, extensions and features should have minimal interdependency. You should be able to pick and choose which ones you want, and discard the rest.
* The tools should be reusable, flexible and powerful. I made them precisely so I don't have to start from scratch every time, In fact, the goal is to use them with minimal modification.
* Easy to use. A hammer is only as good as its handle. Likewise, the tools should be easy to learn and use. Visit the wiki, which is continually being written, and check for documentation on whichever tool you're trying to learn/use.

## Included Tools
Here are the tools included in the project:
* PropertyDrawer and field attribute to support **_interfaces in the inspector_**.
* A **_read-only inspector field_** attribute
* A **_field attribute, that glows red in the inspector if its dependency is not fulfilled_**.
* A **_field attribute, that only displays a field if a separate bool field is true_**.
* Base **_classes for easy grid-related functionality_**.
* An improved **_grid layout class with superior customizability_**, called a Flexible Grid Layout.
* A prepackaged, flexible **_framework for Parallax effects_**. 
* A simple **_framework for displaying progress bars_**.
* A serialized, **_inspector-viewable Dictionary class_**.
* A template, **_inherit-and-forget singleton class_**.
* A ScritptableObject-based **_state machine implementation_**.
* A very simple **_trigger class that keeps track of colliders inside it_**.
* A small **_set of extensions for ScriptableObject that reduce boilerplate code_**.
* A simple **_framework for randomly drawing objects_** from a pool using weights.
* A reusable and highly flexible **_framework for handling health and damage_**, inspired by Unreal Engine's damage framework.
* A **_framework for handling simple player interaction with objects_**.
* A feature-rich and highly extensible **_framework for pooling objects_**.
* An extensible and flexible **_framework for saving data_**.
* An easy-to-work-with **_framework that helps manage UI Windows_**. 
  
  
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the latest UnityPackage and visit the wiki. Pick and choose which tools are useful to you, and then simply use them in your project. You'll need to add a reference to the Ninito.UsualSuspects assembly.

### Prerequisites

The tools were tested in Unity 2019 LST and 2020 LTS. Newer versions should work, but use them there at your own risk.

### Installation

1. Download the latest UnityPackage and import into your project.
2. Add a reference to the Ninito.UsualSuspects assembly to your core assembly.
